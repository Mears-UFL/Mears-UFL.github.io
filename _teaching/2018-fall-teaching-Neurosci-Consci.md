In this class we will consider cutting edge research of brain mechanisms and neural signs as we discuss abnormal, disrupted, and non-human consciousness. Relevant topics to the neuroscience of consciousness will include altered states, anesthesia, coma, dreaming, free-will, hallucinations, illusions, and imagination. As a result of this class, we will have a better understanding of the potential function of consciousness and be able to differentiate conscious from unconscious processes.
