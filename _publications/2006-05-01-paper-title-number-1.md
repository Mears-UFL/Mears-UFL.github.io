This paper is about the neural acivity of medial prefrontal cortex in freely behaving rats. To our knowledge this was the first study to find single-unit responses of individual neurons to repetitive auditory stimuli. The response was reduced for a second stimulus in a pair of auditory tone stimuli. This reduction occurred at intervals equal to or less than 1 sec but not for 4 sec.
