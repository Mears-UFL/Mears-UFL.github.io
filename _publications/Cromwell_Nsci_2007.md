excerpt: 'The present data show that striatal cells do respond to auditory information and display IG of this sensory input. IG in this neural subregion is more sparse in terms of the percentage of sensory responsive cells that gate compared with other structures that have been investigated such as the medial prefrontal cortex (Mears et al., 2006) and amygdala (Cromwell et al., 2005a).'

The present data show that striatal cells do respond to
auditory information and display IG of this sensory input.
IG in this neural subregion is more sparse in terms of the
percentage of sensory responsive cells that gate compared
with other structures that have been investigated
such as the medial prefrontal cortex (Mears et al., 2006)
and amygdala (Cromwell et al., 2005a).
