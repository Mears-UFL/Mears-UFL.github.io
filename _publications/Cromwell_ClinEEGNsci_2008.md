permalink: /publication/Cromwell_ClinEEGNsci_2008
excerpt: 'This review presented a framework for translation of findings in preclinical and clinical investigations of sensory gating. This translational framework has been used in our prior studies to compare sensory gating in homologous neuroanatomical structures and systems of human and animal subjects. The invasive approach affords detailed information on the local-circuit components of each brain region.'

This review presented a framework for translation of findings in preclinical and clinical investigations of sensory gating. This translational framework has been used in our prior studies to compare sensory gating in homologous neuroanatomical structures and systems of human and animal subjects. The invasive approach affords detailed information on the local-circuit components of each brain region.
